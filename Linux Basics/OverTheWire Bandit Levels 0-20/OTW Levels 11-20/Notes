Level12(Bandit11-12) password in data.txt - 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4

I displayed the contents of the "data.txt" file by using "cat data.txt" with this command the output is - "Gur cnffjbeq vf 7k16JArUVv5LxVuJfsSVdbbtaHGlw9D4", this is encrypted using the "ROT13" encryption. user can encrypt any information using the following command "tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' <<< "example text to be encrypted"

the command "tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'" can also be used to decrypt ROT13 encrypted, here is the complete command I used to get the answer "tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' <<< Gur cnffjbeq vf 7k16JArUVv5LxVuJfsSVdbbtaHGlw9D4" the output of the command was "The password is 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4".

Level 13 (Bandit12-13) password found in data9.bin - FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn

To get to the file, I had to use different decompressioning tools such as gzip, tar and bzip2. First I created the temp directory using "mktemp -d", once an output was produced I then created a copy and move that copy into the new directory. I then created another copy of the copied data.txt file, this newer copy name data.bin was used to as the starting point to find the password.

using file to find the compression type, I kept compressing and redirecting using "gunzip < data8.bin > data9.bin" move the decompressed data into another file to continue decompressing, going from compresseed file types to POSIX tar Archive to finally ASCII text type, which had the completely decompressed answer.

This one took me sometime to figure out, going online and understanding file type, loved this challenge. Onto the next one.
